If you Google “Blockchain Constitution” you will discover my prior post on “Why every Blockchain needs a Constitution” as the number 2 hit. Today I would like to expand upon why and how one would go about creating an meaningful, enforceable constitution.
如果你谷歌一下“Blockchain Constitution”，你会发现我之前发布的关于“为什么每个区块链需要宪法”的帖子都排在第二位（译者按，截止2018-04-12为第三位）。 今天我想谈谈为什么以及如何创建一个有意义的，可执行的宪法（排第二位）。

As those who have followed me over the years know, it is my continuing mission to discover free market solutions for securing life, liberty, and property. I started this mission because I believe it is possible to create a well ordered society without resorting to violence. When people think of anarchy, anarcho capitalism, libertarianism, and voluntarism they immediately think of all the problems that would exist without government. What do you call a system of governance that is purely voluntary and absent of violence? Can any such system have teeth?
正如那些多年来一直关注我的人所知道的那样，我的一贯使命是发现用于保护生命，自由和财产的自由市场解决方案。 我开始这个任务，是因为我相信有可能创建一个秩序良好的社会而不诉诸暴力。 当人们想到无政府主义，无政府主义资本主义，自由主义和自愿主义时，他们立即想到了没有政府就会存在的所有问题。 你怎么称呼纯粹是自愿的，没有暴力的治理体系？ 任何这样的系统是强大有效的吗？

What is Governance?
什么是治理？

Governance is the process by which decisions are made by a group of people. At its heart is the concept of dispute resolution. Any time two or more people are involved in making a decision disputes will arise. A solid governance system is a process for dispute resolution over which there is prior agreement and therefore no dispute. If people can agree on the process, then they can usually live with the outcome.
治理是由一群人作出决定的过程。 其核心是解决争端的概念。 任何时候有两个或两个以上的人参与决策时就可能出现纠纷。 坚实的治理体系是争议解决的过程，事先达成协议并因此不存在争议。 如果人们能够就这个过程达成一致，那么他们通常可以和平共处。

What should be Governed?
应该治理什么？
The biggest challenge for any group of people is the allocation of Rights: who can do what and when. The most basic Right is property rights and from that all other Rights can be derived. Our first property claim is our body and from that claim our right to control how it is used.
对于任何一群人来说，最大的挑战是权利的分配：谁可以做什么，什么时候做。 最基本的权利是财产权，而所有其他权利都可以衍生出来。 我们的第一项财产声明是我们的身体，我们有权控制使用它的方式。

Contracts are a process by which people agree to grant and exchange Rights under certain circumstances.
合约是人们在某些情况下同意授予和交换权利的过程。

A free and prosperous society is derived from efficient governance over property right disputes and therefore all contract disputes. This means that a system of governance ultimately must govern all of our mutual Rights. If we can agree on an efficient and honest, logically consistent, process for determining who owns what and when, then we can have a peaceful and prosperous society.
一个自由繁荣的社会源于对产权和合约纠纷的有效治理。 这意味着治理体系最终必须监管我们所有的相互权利。 如果我们能够就高效，诚实，逻辑一致的流程达成一致，确定谁在何时何地拥有什么（权利），那么我们就可以建立一个和平繁荣的社会。

How should Rights be Governed?
如何管理权利？

Ambiguity over rights is the source of most disputes. Any time things are ambiguous, or subject for interpretation, there is an opportunity for dispute. It could be said that an ounce of dispute prevention is worth a pound of cure. If we want to minimize ambiguity then we need to formalize contracts in computer code and have them evaluated in a transparent and reproducible manner. In other words, smart contracts can be considered a means to reduce ambiguity in contracts and the dispute resolution process.
对权利的歧义是大多数争议的根源。 任何时候如果事情是模棱两可，或者需要解释的，都可能产生争议。 可以说，一盎司的纠纷预防值得一磅的治疗。 如果我们想要最小化歧义，那么我们需要在计算机代码中形式化合约，并以透明和可重复的方式对它们进行评估。 换句话说，智能合约可以被视为减少合约和争议解决过程中的歧义的手段。

Ideally everything could be resolved by perfectly executing computer code, but that would require the code to have perfect knowledge, a sense of equity, and the ability to discern between the explicit instructions we gave it and the intent of the instructions we gave which may not be the same thing.
理想情况下，一切都可以通过执行计算机代码来完美解决，但这需要代码具有完美的知识，公平性，并且能够辨别我们给出的明确指示和我们给出的指示的意图是一回事。

For this reason it is necessary for us to have humans involved in governance to cover the situations where code fails or is unable to resolve disputes.
出于这个原因，我们有必要让参与治理的人来接手代码失败或无法解决争端的情况。

Property Rights are a Treaty
产权是一项条约
It is commonly held that our rights are derived by virtue of being human; however, not all humans agree with that premise. Many people believe in the law of the jungle, that might makes right. Rights are a concept that we grant to others so that others will grant them to us in return. It is a peace treaty that frees us from the need to defend ourselves against those who sign it and enables everyone to devote more time and resources toward more productive activities.
人们普遍认为，我们的权利是以人为本而获得的; 然而，并非所有人都同意这一前提。 许多人都相信丛林的法则，这也许是对的。 权利是我们授予他人的一个概念，以便其他人将这些概念授予我们作为回报。 这是一项和平条约，使我们摆脱了为自己辩护的需要，使每个人都能投入更多时间和资源用于更有成效的活动。

Under this view of property rights, you only have rights by virtue of your explicit consent with two or more people who grant those rights to you. Without such an agreement we revert to the law of the jungle. No one claims a bear is violating their “rights”. Nature knows no rights; we only imagine them to exist. The bear never agreed not to maul you, and likewise unless other people agree not to maul you they haven’t violated your rights by mauling you. Afterall, did you ever promise not to maul them? What consideration did you give in exchange for the rights you imagine to have? Does the other party you expect to respect your rights consider the terms fair?
根据这种产权观点，您只有在您明确同意两个或两个以上授予您权利的人的情况下才有权利。 没有这样的协议，我们会退回到丛林法则。 没有人会认为熊侵犯了他们的“权利”。 大自然不知道权利; 我们只想象它们存在。 熊从来没有同意不欺骗你，同样，除非别人同意不要欺骗你，否则他们没有侵犯你的权利。 毕竟，你有没有答应不要欺骗他们？ 你对你想得到的权利给予了什么考虑？ 你希望尊重你的权利的另一方认为条款公平吗？

This philosophical approach may appear repugnant to those who are convinced that they are owed certain rights by virtue of being human. This is a view I once held, but now see as wishful thinking of an individual wanting to impose terms of a peace treaty on everyone else. Instead what this individual should be doing is organizing his own community among people that will grant rights to each other with an eye toward mutual defense against aggressors.
这种哲学方法可能会让那些相信他们是由于人类的美德而拥有某些权利的人感到厌恶。这是我曾经持有的一种看法，但现在看到的是一个想要将和平条约的条款强加给其他人的一厢情愿的想法。 相反，这个人应该做的是在他们之间组织自己的社区，相互授权，着眼于与侵略者的相互防御。

We demand the government to recognize our rights and we all protest when we feel the government is violating its constitution. The fact is that governments are strong, powerful groups of people which represent a force no individual can defend against which makes us wish we could prove they are in the wrong and we are the victim. Sadly, they force us to sign their contracts under threats of imprisonment or death if we refuse. Then they claim we consented despite the obvious duress.
我们要求政府承认我们的权利，当我们感到政府违反宪法时，我们都会抗议。 事实是，各国政府都是强大群体，代表着一种没有个人能够抵御的力量，这使我们希望我们能证明他们是错的，而我们是受害者。 可悲的是，如果我们拒绝，他们迫使我们在监禁或死亡的威胁下签署合约。 然后他们声称我们同意，尽管有明显的胁迫。

It is not possible to enter a contract while under threat of overpowering violence. Therefore, there is no contract between us and our so-called government. Therefore there are no more rights between us and our government than between us and a bear. In fact, the government doesn’t actually exist! It is a figment of our collective imagination and any violation of our perceived rights can only be by individuals with whom we have not signed any contract.
在有压倒一切的暴力威胁的情况下，不可能签订合同。因此，我们和所谓的政府之间没有合同。因此，我们和政府之间没有比我们和熊更多的权利了。事实上，政府根本就不存在!这是我们集体想象的虚构，任何侵犯我们感知权利的行为都只能是我们没有签署任何合同的个人。

A Constitution is a multi-party Contract
宪法是多方合约

Any two people can create a contract where they agree to recognize each other’s rights and agree to allow a 3rd party to resolve any dispute. The most common way this is done is via an arbitration clause in a contract. The ruling of binding Arbitration is generally enforceable in all countries around the world by virtue of numerous arbitration treaties.
任何两个人都可以在他们同意承认彼此的权利并且同意允许第三方解决任何争议的情况下创建合约。 最常见的做法是通过合约中的仲裁条款。 有约束力的仲裁裁决通常可以在世界各国根据众多仲裁条约强制执行。

There are many reasons to agree to Arbitration including:
同意仲裁的理由很多，其中包括：

Faster
Cheaper
Privacy
Choice of Law
Fairness
International Disputes
Controlling Jurisdiction
Knowledge of Judge
更快
便宜
隐私
法律的选择
公平
国际争端
控制司法权
法官的知识

Without an arbitration agreement between two parties, a dispute can be brought in any number of countries with any number of different applicable laws, non of which the parties consented to. The parties can shop jurisdictions for those most favorable to them and least favorable to the opposing party. Governments around the world can pass new laws and set precedents that might invalidate the intent of the parties contract.
如果没有双方之间的仲裁协议，就可以在任何数量的国家中提出任何适用的法律，而不是由各方同意的。政党可以为那些对他们最有利的人设立司法管辖区，并且对对方最不有利。世界各国政府都可以通过新的法律，并设立一些先例，从而使双方的意图无效。

If we want to create a free society with an honest dispute resolution and property right allocation, then we must take control of Jurisdiction and Choice of Law. Fortunately, this is easy to do with an internationally recognized Arbitration clause and dispute resolution forum that employ the Maxims of equity.
如果我们想要建立一个诚实的争端解决和产权分配的自由社会，那么我们就必须控制司法权和法律选择。 幸运的是，国际公认的仲裁条款和争议解决论坛经常采用这种方法，以便最大化公平正义。

Counterparts
同行

You may have seen clauses like the following in various contracts you have signed:
您可能已在您签署的各种合约中看到类似以下的条款：

This Contract may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which when executed and delivered shall constitute a duplicate original, but all counterparts together shall constitute a single agreement.
本合同可以在任何数量的副本中执行，每一个副本在执行和交付时应构成一份副本原件，但所有副本应构成一份单独的协议。

What this is saying is that two different people can sign two different copies of the same contract and it has the effect as if both signed the same contract. This language is incredibly common even though it is almost unnecessary as most courts will recognize signed Counterparts as one document even without such a clause.
这就是说，两个不同的人可以签署同一合约的两份不同的副本，其效果就好像两个签署了同样的合约一样。 这种语言非常普遍，即使它们几乎是没不必要的，因为即使没有这样的条款，大多数法院都会将签署的副本识别为一个文件。

Therefore, two parties who both sign a separate copy of Constitution can be considered to have signed the same contract where the Constitution is a contract.
因此，双方签署了一份单独的宪法副本，可以被认为是签署了同一份合同，而宪法是一份合同。

Constitution as a Contract
宪法作为一个合同

A constitution can be viewed as a contract and enforced as such around the world. This contract can establish choice of law, choice of arbitration forum, and allocate any other lawful rights among the parties. In order to be viewed as a valid contract it must have several elements:
宪法可以被看作是一种契约，并在全球范围内被强制执行。 该合约可以建立法律选择，仲裁论坛的选择，并在当事人之间分配任何其他合法权利。 为了被视为有效的合约，它必须有几个要素：

Offer
Acceptance
Consideration
Mutuality
Competency / Capacity
Ideally a Written Instrument
The Offer
提供
验收
考虑
相互关系
技能/能力
理想的书面文书
报价

The constitution is an open offer to anyone willing to accept it. In this offer the offeree is agreeing to participate in dispute resolution and to take reasonable, non-violent, actions to recognize and restore the property rights of another using a mutually agreed upon process (e.g. smart contracts). The person accepting this offer is granted validation of their property right and the benefits of an efficient process for managing and transferring their rights.
宪法对任何愿意接受宪法的人都是开放的。在此要约中，受要约人同意参与争议解决，并采取合理、非暴力的行动，通过双方商定的程序(例如，智能合同)来确认和恢复另一方的产权。接受该要约的人被授予对其产权的确认，以及有效管理和转让其权利的过程的好处。

Acceptance
验收

There are many ways to demonstrate acceptance, including: digital signature, physical signature, verbal agreement, depositing a check, or other actions that demonstrate your voluntary choice to partake in the benefits of the agreement. Use of a blockchain and signing a transaction that incorporates the hash of the contract is a valid proof of acceptance.
有许多方法可以证明接受，包括:数字签名、物理签名、口头协议、支票，或其他表明你自愿选择参与协议利益的行为。使用区块链和签署包含合同散列的事务是接受的有效证明。

Consideration
考虑

A constitution that offers both parties an equal trade of rights and obligations comes at equal expense and benefits to both parties. These benefits have material value to the parties and come at material expense.
为双方提供平等的权利和义务交易的宪法对双方都是等同的，并且有利于双方。 这些利益对各方具有重大价值，并且以物质费用为代价。

Mutuality
相互关系
Nothing could be more mutual than a Constitution that imposes equal rights, benefits, and obligations on all parties.
没有什么比宪法赋予各方平等的权利、利益和义务更能相互促进的了。

Competency / Capacity
技力/能力
This particular loophole may allow some individuals to escape the enforcement of the contract, but is of little concern to the vast majority of people.
这个特殊的漏洞可能会让一些人逃避合约的执行，但对绝大多数人来说并没有什么关系。

Written Instrument
书面文书

A public Constitution identified by cryptographic hash and signed by digital signatures is about as solid and verifiable, indisputable, written instrument as one could hope to come across.
通过加密散列识别并通过数字签名签名的公共宪法，就像人们可能希望遇到的那样，是一种可靠且可验证的，无可争议的书面文书。

Enforcing the Contract
执行合约

Ok, so we have identified that a constitution can be drafted as a simple multi-party contract that all parties executed in counterpart by virtue of using a particular blockchain. How does one go about enforcing the terms when you may not know anything about the other party other than their blockchain account name.
好的，所以我们已经确定，宪法可以作为一个简单的多方合约来起草，所有各方通过使用特定的区块链来执行。当你可能不知道对方除了区块链账户之外的其他任何东西时，你该如何执行这些条款呢?

Serving Notice of Dispute
争议通知书

The first and most important aspect of bringing a suit against someone is knowing how to properly serve them. This is something that must be specified in the contract and recognized by the arbitration forum. Fortunately, a blockchain is a public record where notices can be delivered to any and all parties to the constitution. Afterall, unless you have an account it is unlikely you signed the constitution / contract.
对某人提起诉讼的第一个也是最重要的方面是知道如何正确地为他们提供服务。 这是合约中必须明确规定并得到仲裁论坛认可的事情。 幸运的是，区块链是公共记录，可以将通知送达任何和所有的宪法缔约方。毕竟，除非你有一个账户，否则你不可能签署宪法/合同。

If you publish notice of your dispute to the blockchain and the other party refuses to participate in the arbitration process, then he or she will lose by default and a ruling can be made against the account. To prevent abuse the loser has to cover the legal costs and time of the winner’s fair market rates.
如果您将争议的通知发布到区块链上，而另一方拒绝参与仲裁程序，则他或她将因违约而失利，并可对账户进行裁决。 为了防止滥用，失败者必须承担赢家公平市场费率的法律费用和时间。

Know your Customer
了解你的客户
Generally speaking, if you are doing business with someone and there is some probability of dispute then you should likely gather information from them that will help you prove they have signed the constitution and submit an arbitration ruling in your local courts for enforcement. This can happen in many ways, but the simple process of asking them to send a signed payment request or a purchase order via the blockchain is enough to tie their account to the address you are shipping the good or service to.
一般来说，如果您正在与某人做生意，并且存在一些争议的可能性，那么您应该从他们那里收集信息，以帮助您证明他们已经签署了宪法，并在当地法院提交仲裁裁决执行。 这可能以多种方式发生，但要求他们通过区块链发送已签署的付款申请或采购订单的简单流程足以将其帐户绑定到您正在运送商品或服务的地址。

Pseudo Anonymous Dispute Resolution
伪匿名争议解决

May services, such as VPNs, allow customers to pay via Bitcoin and take no other identifying information. If the user of the VPN violates the Terms of Service then the VPN operator may have claims for damages, but no ability to know how to bring them to justice.
5月份的服务，例如VPN，允许客户通过比特币支付，并且不采用其他识别信息。 如果VPN的用户违反了服务条款，则VPN运营商可能会要求赔偿损失，但无法知道如何将其绳之以法。

A blockchain with Constitution and built in method for delivering notice of request for Arbitration can enable the VPN service provider to get a ruling against a Pseudo Anonymous account. The account owner will either have to identify themselves or defend themselves Pseudo Anonymously or they may lose the dispute by default.
具有宪法的区块链和内置仲裁请求通知的方法可以使VPN服务提供商对伪匿名账户进行裁决。 账户所有者要么必须认证自己，要么匿名进行辩护，或者默认情况下可能会失去争议。

Once a ruling is entered the entire community will be aware of the judgment and if the real identity of the account owner is ever found then it will be binding on them. In all likelihood the rulings would even be enforced by governments around the world.
一旦进入裁决，整个社区都会意识到判决结果，如果发现账户所有人的真实身份，那么它将对他们有约束力。 很有可能这些裁决甚至会被世界各国政府执行。

The ideal situation in these cases is for accounts to be bonded and insured. In this way individual identity can be kept private from everyone while still enabling certain guarantees of payment in a dispute.
这些情况下的理想情况是账户被保税和保险。 通过这种方式，个人身份可以保持对每个人都是私密的，同时仍然可以在争议中支付某些保证金。

Block Producers can Expel Accounts in Bad Standing
块生产商可以推翻坏账

All blockchains have a group of block producers with the power to collectively block any account they desire. Bitcoin miners use fees as the basis for blocking certain transactions. Steem uses rate limiting to do the same. It is also possible for Block Producers to block transactions from accounts until the individual behind the account complies with a public ruling against them.
所有区块链都有一组区块生产商，可以共同阻止他们想要的任何帐户。 比特币矿工使用费用作为阻止某些交易的基础。 Steem使用速率限制来做同样的事情。 阻止生产者也可以阻止账户交易，直到账户中的个人遵守针对他们的公开裁决。

The benefit of having 21+ elected block producers is that it requires sustained unanimous consent to execute such a punitive measure. The reality is that the elected producers can and should set up a smart contract based process to reach consensus on when to utilize this power to enforce a ruling.
拥有21个以上选定的区块生产者的好处是，它需要持续一致同意执行这种惩罚性措施。 现实情况是，当选的生产者可以并且应该建立一个基于合约的智能流程，以就何时利用这一权力执行裁决达成共识。

Businesses can Shun Accounts
企业可以避开账户

Just like producers can block transactions, businesses can quickly review the record of any account to determine whether it is in good standing. An account in bad standing can be denied service based upon the principle of freedom of association. The goal of a governance system is to make it easier to get verified background checks.
就像生产者可以阻止交易一样，企业可以快速审查任何帐户的记录，以确定它是否具有良好的信誉。根据结社自由原则，在不良状态下的帐户可以被拒绝服务。治理系统的目标是使验证背景检查变得更容易。



How is this less corrupt than what we have today?
这比我们今天所拥有的腐败更少吗?

Those of us who are sensitive to abuse of power and corruption of individuals within a system may be feeling sad right now. The promise of rule by benevolent artificially intelligent blockchain overlords just seems so ideal after centuries of government corruption.
我们中那些对滥用权力和个人的腐败敏感的人现在可能感到悲伤。在几个世纪的政府腐败之后，仁慈的、人工智能的区块链霸主的承诺似乎是非常理想的。

What good does it do us to construct a blockchain with a constitution that enables users to bring other users to arbitration in a court governed by corruptible people? Won’t this result in arbitrary rulings and ultimately arbitrary law?
我们用宪法来构建一个区块链，让用户可以把其他用户带到一个被腐败的人民所管辖的法庭上进行仲裁，这有什么用呢?这不会导致武断的裁决和最终的任意法律吗?

Here are the key differences:
以下是主要区别：

All parties explicitly consent without threat of violence
所有各方明确同意而不受暴力威胁

All parties explicitly agree to refrain from aggression and aim for logical consistency
所有各方明确同意不进行侵略，并争取逻辑一致

A much larger part of your rights is governed by logically consistent code 
权利的很大一部分受逻辑一致性代码控制

Enforcement is limited to non-violent actions on a public ledger
执法局限于对公共总账的非暴力行为

Precedent (aka the fallacy of appeal to authority) can be explicitly excluded from being valid basis for an arbitration ruling, all decisions should be independently derived from facts and reason. This prevents one bad / corrupt decision from compounding over time and hopefully prevents legislation by judges.
先决条件（又名上诉权威谬误）可明确排除在仲裁裁决的有效依据之上，所有决定应独立于事实和理由。 这可以防止一次糟糕/腐败的决定随着时间的推移而复发，并有望阻止法官的立法。

All of that stated, the single biggest things that drive corruption out and integrity up is free market competition, transparency, and immediate public referendum.
所有这些都说明，推动腐败和诚信的最重要的事情是自由市场竞争，透明度和即时全民投票。

No system is perfect when it must be designed and operated by humans with competing value systems and agendas. Hopefully we can find new ways to work together that raise the bar enough to make a difference in the quality of our lives and those of our children.
没有制度是完美的，因为它必须由具有竞争价值体系和议程的人来设计和操作。 希望我们能够找到新的方式共同努力，提高标准，使我们的生活质量和我们孩子的生活质量有所不同。

What would you like to see in a Constitution?
你想在宪法中看到什么？
